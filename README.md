This project is a simulation of the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol, a routing protocol designed for wireless ad hoc networks. The DSR protocol dynamically discovers routes between nodes without relying on centralized routing infrastructure, making it an ideal solution for wireless networks.

As part of this assignment for a Wireless Networking Course, the goal is to implement the route discovery process of the DSR protocol. The program simulates a graph-based network where nodes communicate to discover paths dynamically. The task includes:

Broadcasting route request packets (RREQ) between nodes.
Handling route caches to store discovered routes.
Outputting the path found during the route discovery process.
This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of dynamic routing in distributed networks and provides a hands-on understanding of ad hoc network operations.
